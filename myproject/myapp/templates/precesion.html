  Precision Farming: Everything You Need to Know</h1>
<p>Precision farming is revolutionizing agriculture. So much so that most industry pundits consider the advance of precision agriculture as fundamentally disruptive to sustainable agriculture and food production as was the invention of the John Deere steel plow in the mid-1800s.</p>

<p>Already the inclusion of new data-collection tools and the Internet of Things (IoT) combined with GPS, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and satellite imagery is enabling farmers to optimize their decision-making. A 2021 study published by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) concluded that precision farming technologies have already increased farmers’ production by 4%, reduced their fertilizer use by 7%, decreased herbicide applications by 9%, lowered fossil fuel use by 6% and gained a 4% savings in water use.</p>


<p>According to the <a href="United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)">United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a>, as more and more farmers adopt precision ag techniques and new technologies, agricultural systems will use fewer resources and ultimately be more sustainable.

<h2 class="headings">What Is Precision Farming?</h2>
    

<p>Precision Farming or Precision Agriculture is a concept of using the new technologies and collected field information, doing the right thing, in the right place, at the right time. Collected information may be used to more precisely evaluate optimum sowing density, estimate fertilizers and other input needs, and to more accurately predict crop yields.
</p>

<p>
  • It helps in avoiding unwanted practices to a crop, regardless of local soil/climate conditions, i.e., it reduces labour, water, inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides etc. and assures quality produce.</p>

  <p>• It is a new method of farming that tailors inputs of fertilizers, pesticides etc. to match the variation in the growing conditions with in a field. The practice is known as Site Specific Management.
  </p>

  <p>•  In other words it is "Digital Agriculture" involving very large scale farm level mapping, comprehensive database creation on required resources generated through space based inputs and field observations and making a detailed plan of work for maximizing the yield and reducing the cost on inputs using Decision Support System</p>



<h2 class="heading1">How Does Precision Farming Increase Farm Sustainability?</h2>

<p>Farmers use precision farming in many aspects of their farming practices to make resource management decisions based upon on-site and real-time data collected in their fields..</p>

<p>
The earliest, and most commonly used, precision ag technique is for variable rate applications of inputs. Variable rate technology (VRT) is installed on seeders, and fertilizers and is now being added to irrigation systems like center pivot systems. Variable rate technology (VRT) allows farmers to precisely vary how much and where they apply inputs (seed, fertilizer or water) based on overlaying data sources, like soil maps, prior harvest yield maps or imagery collected from drones, and airplanes or satellites. Prior to seeding or applying an input, a farmer will run a “prescription,” aka “script,” that gives the machine being used a precise GIS-enabled map with instructions of how much input to apply at what point in the field. The farmer enables auto-steer and their GPS program in their tractor and then lets the variable rate program automatically follow the script, with no further input needed from them. </p>

<h2 class="heading1" style="margin-top: -50px;">What Are the Components of Precision Farming?</h2>
<p><strong>Global Positioning System (GPS):</strong> GPS technology is fundamental to precision farming. It allows farmers to accurately map and track the location of their equipment and activities in the field. This information is crucial for creating precise field maps, </p>
<p><strong>Sensors and Monitoring Devices:</strong>Various sensors are used to collect real-time data on soil conditions, crop health, weather, and other important variables. For example, soil sensors can measure moisture levels and nutrient content, helping farmers make informed decisions about irrigation and fertilization</p>

<p><strong>Variable Rate Technology (VRT):</strong> VRT enables farmers to vary the rate of inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and water based on the specific needs of different areas within a field. This targeted application helps optimize resource use and minimize waste, contributing to both cost savings and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Machinery: </strong>Precision farming often involves the use of automated machinery, such as GPS-guided tractors and harvesters. These machines can follow pre-defined paths with high accuracy, reducing overlap and ensuring that tasks are performed efficiently. Automation also contributes to labor savings and increased productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Data Management and Analytics:</strong> The collection of large amounts of data necessitates advanced data management and analytics tools. Farmers use software platforms to analyze the gathered information, generate insights, and make data-driven decisions. This helps in optimizing crop management strategies and improving overall farm efficiency.</p>


<p><strong>Remote Sensing: </strong>Remote sensing technologies, including satellite and aerial imagery, provide a comprehensive view of large agricultural areas. This data helps farmers assess crop health, identify potential issues, and make timely interventions.</p>

<p><strong>Communication Systems: </strong>Efficient communication systems are essential for transmitting data between different components of the precision farming system. This includes communication between sensors, machinery, and data analysis platforms. Reliable communication ensures that information is shared seamlessly for effective decision-making.</p>


<p><strong>Farm Management Software: </strong>Farm management software integrates various data sources and provides a centralized platform for farmers to monitor and manage their operations. These software solutions often include features such as mapping, inventory tracking, and performance analysis to support better decision-making.</p>



<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);margin-left: 5.5rem;">Advantages and Disadvantages of Precision Agriculture</h2>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to precision agriculture farming should consider. </p>

 <h4 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);margin-left: 5.5rem;"> Advantages of Precision Ag Technology</h4>
  
  <p>Precision management technology gives farmers more precise information to enable better decision-making and enables real-time action on that information. The end results are a better use of resources enabling more sustainable practices and saving time and money while not sacrificing profitability.</p>

  <h4 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);margin-left: 5.5rem;">Disadvantages of Precision Ag Technology</h4>
  <p>The disadvantages of precision farming include buying new tech-enabled equipment or enrolling in tech platforms which can be a daunting additional expense on a lean farm budget. Farmers have to carefully weigh their potential gains of precision farming technology against the added expense. Many farmers complain they have more data than they know what to do with through their precision equipment. And they don’t have the time or knowledge to understand or analyze it.</p>
